****** Welcome ******
This project exposes the custom XHTML element 'w3-include-xhtml' 
as defined by the DTD extension:

    <!ELEMENT w3-include-xhtml EMPTY>
    <!ATTLIST w3-include-xhtml href CDATA #REQUIRED>

The naming scheme is also compatible with 
W3C_Custom_Elements_Proposal <https://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/>, 
being incooperated within 
W3C_DOM Spec <https://www.w3.org/TR/dom41/#interface-element>
and the W3C_HTML_SPEC <https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/semantics-scripting.html#custom-elements-core-concepts>.
Also see the WHATWG DOM Spec <https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-element>
and the WHATWG HTML Spec <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html>.

Remaining question: How can we surpass the W3C Markup Validation Service <http://validator.w3.org/>?

If you see any other text elements besides this text block in 'index.html', 
the custom XHTML element w3-include-xhtml is operating.
In detail, a header HEADER, a sidebar SIDEBAR and a footer FOOTER shall be
visible via three w3-include-xhtml elements.
